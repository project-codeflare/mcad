# MicroMCAD

This repository contains a prototype MCAD implementation
([multi-cluster-app-dispatcher](https://github.com/project-codeflare/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher))
using recent versions of [controller
runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) and
[kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder). This prototype
does not implement quotas.

Multi-cluster support assumes the use of [KubeStellar](https://kubestellar.io)
syncers. A simple [syncer.js](syncer/syncer.js) is provided as possible
substitute for development.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running locally against cluster

Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

 Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

Uninstall the CRDs:
```sh
make uninstall
```

### Running on the cluster

Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mcad:<some-tag>
```

Deploy the CRDs and controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mcad:<some-tag>
```

Undeploy the CRDs and controller from the cluster:
```sh
make undeploy
```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
