# Active development on MCAD v2 has ended

**In 2024, the MCAD developers joined the [Kueue community](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue).
We stopped working on MCAD as a standalone project and shifted to bringing the lessons learned
from MCAD to Kueue.  We developed a new [Kueue-compatabile version of AppWrapper](https://github.com/project-codeflare/appwrapper)
which makes MCAD's support for complex workloads and advanced fault tolerance available to users of Kueue.**

# MCAD v2

## Overview

This repository contains a reimplementation of MCAD
([multi-cluster-app-dispatcher](https://github.com/project-codeflare/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher))
using recent versions of [controller
runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) and
[kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).

This reimplementation does not support quotas or dispatching to multiple
clusters yet.

See [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) for instructions on how to port AppWrappers from
MCAD to MCAD v2.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running locally against cluster

Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

 Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

Uninstall the CRDs:
```sh
make uninstall
```

### Running on the cluster

Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<image-name>:<image-tag>
```

Or build and push a multi-architecture image with:
```sh
make docker-buildx IMG=<image-name>:<image-tag>
```

Deploy the CRDs and controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
```sh
make deploy IMG=<image-name>:<image-tag>
```

Undeploy the CRDs and controller from the cluster:
```sh
make undeploy
```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

## Helm Chart

Alternatively, MCAD can be installed on a cluster using Helm.

Install the CRDs and controller in the `mcad-system` namespace:
```sh
helm install --namespace mcad-system mcad-controller deployment/mcad-controller \
  --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=<image-name> \
  --set image.tag=<image-tag> \
  --set resources.requests.cpu=100m \
  --set resources.requests.memory=512Mi \
  --set resources.limits.cpu=2000m \
  --set resources.limits.memory=4096Mi
```

Uninstall from `mcad-system` namespace:
```sh
helm uninstall mcad-controller -n mcad-system
```

Uninstall CRDs:
```sh
kubectl delete crd appwrappers.workload.codeflare.dev
```

## Pre-commit hooks

This repository includes pre-configured pre-commit hooks. Make sure to install
the hooks immediately after cloning the repository:
```sh
pre-commit install
```
See [https://pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com) for prerequisites.

## Running tests locally

You can do `make run-e2e` to build MCAD and run the entire
test suite against it on freshly created `kind` cluster in
a fully automated fashion.  For development purposes, other
modes are also supported. See the detailed instructons in
[test/README.md](test/README.md) for more details.
